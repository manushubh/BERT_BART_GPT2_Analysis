His appeal against the verdict has been pending in the high court. Ariz Khan had fled from the spot and was declared proclaimed offender.

Turns out, what Europe experienced in the last few years is worse than what happened in the last 2,000 years.An International team led by cambridge's Department off Geography, studied the chemical fingerprints on European Oak trees to reconstruct Summer Climate over 2100 years spanning from 75BC to 2018.Büntgen  particularly enable to decode the complete pic of past draught variations, which helped them for functioning of ecosystem and societies.Climate change is not getting drier everywhere, some place can be wetter or colder to some extreme conditions which may be devastating for agriculture,ecosystem or whole. the tweet shared by U.K. Green Party also stated that if we dont reduce carbon emissions it will get worse.If trees don’t get enough water, they become more susceptible to pests, disease, and fires.

The study was undertaken by researchers at the CzechGlobe centre, and referred to the sharp rise as particularly scary for agriculture and forestry. \"Our results show that what we have experienced over the past five summers is extraordinary for central Europe, in terms of how dry it has been consecutively,\" dendrochronology specialist and lead author Professor Ulf Büntgen of Cambridge's Department of Geography said in a statement. Büntgen and the team of international researchers linked the recent droughts to the climate crisis, including its impacts on the jet stream. \"Climate change does not mean that it will get drier everywhere: In 2015, severe drought and heat waves spread across Europe causing agricultural output to decline, wildfires to intensify, sources of freshwater to diminish, and hundreds of premature deaths. Some places may get wetter or colder, but extreme conditions will become more frequent, which could be devastating for agriculture, ecosystems, and societies as a whole,\" Büntgen said. If trees don’t get enough water, they become more susceptible to pests, disease, and fires, and struggle to grow, a phenomena that is well underway in Europe. \"Unprecedented forest dieback across much of central Europe corroborates our results.\n",

The findings were published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience. The U.K.Green Party shared The Guardian's reporting on the new study with a tweet declaring, \"Climate change is here.

The study was published in the journal nature Geoscience and analysed 27,000 growth rings from 147 oak trees. Based on this, they determined temperatures from wood density and width. The reconstruction showed an overall drying trend. But the samples showed that the droughts from 2015-2018 were \"unprecedented\" over the massive time span.
